# Build Fetch Display

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and display it on a webpage. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is intended as a learning resource for beginners.

## Features
- Fetch data from a remote API
- Display fetched data dynamically on the page
- Responsive and clean user interface

## File Structure
```
index.html      # Main HTML file
styles.css      # CSS styles for the app
script.js       # JavaScript logic for fetching and displaying data
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No installation required; all files are static

### How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. The app will load and display data fetched from the configured API.

## How It Works
- The JavaScript in `script.js` uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from a remote endpoint.
- Once the data is received, it is parsed and rendered into the HTML structure.
- The CSS in `styles.css` ensures the app looks clean and is responsive.

## Customization
- To change the API endpoint, edit the URL in `script.js`.
- You can modify the HTML structure in `index.html` to change how data is displayed.
- Update `styles.css` to adjust the look and feel of the app.

## Example API
By default, the app may use a public API such as [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for demonstration purposes.

## Troubleshooting
- If data does not display, check the browser console for errors.
- Ensure you have an active internet connection if using a remote API.
